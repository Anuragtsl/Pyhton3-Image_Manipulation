# Pyhton3-Image_Manipulation

In this project I have done some image manipulation using some manipulation techniques.
These techniques can be used for couple of main reasons like saving storage space, improving the quality of traning ML models, and faster running time.

# How to 

You just needed to download any image and save it in images folder.

Then just change the image name in the written code and Done(Easy?).

# Techniques Used

>Image Resize

For one image it doesn’t make much difference but when you think of processing thousands of images in your program,
little size change will save you a lot of time and storage.

>Image Brightness

It’s easy for us to understand what we see when we look at an image, but for machines, it can be a bit challenging.
So, to help machines to process the image better, a little brightness can help to improve the accuracy.

>Image Grayscale

When training a machine, grayscale images are doing much better. The reason is since machines see images as a matrix of arrays, it is easier to store black and white image, instead of multiple images with many colors.

# IDE & Library Used

I have used pillow library in python3 for image manipulation, and Pycharm IDE for coding!
